# Cleaning-and-Analyzing-Employee-Exit-Surveys

This project will showcase our data cleaning and analysis skills as we work on developing them more and more because data cleaning remains a huge part of any data scientist work.

In this project, we are going to clean and analyze exit surveys of Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. The exit survey for the TAFE can be found here and the survey for the DETE here.

The objective of this project will be to find out the following :

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
